# Deferred Features

Planning note: deferred items are ordered in `.agent/plans/linear-delivery-plan.md`.

## Next Steps

- Config file support. All cli args and most .env vars should be configurable via a config file.
- CLI `--version` flag.

## Delivered Early (No Longer Deferred)

- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) was delivered in batch `R-B5`
  and should be treated as baseline infrastructure.
