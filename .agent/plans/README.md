# Plans Index

This directory contains planning documents for active and historical work.

## Active Plans

| File | Purpose | Status | Owner | Last Updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.agent/plans/linear-delivery-plan.md` | Single ordered execution path with milestone requirements and acceptance criteria. | Active | Jim + Codex | 2026-02-06 |
| `.agent/plans/deferred-features.md` | Backlog items not in the active linear path. | Active backlog | Jim + Codex | 2026-02-06 |

## Archived Reference Plans

Legacy or completed planning artefacts live in `.agent/plans/archive/` and are reference-only.
Do not execute directly without explicitly promoting requirements into
`.agent/plans/linear-delivery-plan.md`.

## Operating Rule

1. Start from `.agent/plans/linear-delivery-plan.md` for current implementation.
1. Use `.agent/plans/deferred-features.md` for backlog capture only.
1. Keep archived plans immutable except for historical clarification notes.
